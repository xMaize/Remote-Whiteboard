## What is the problem we're trying to solve?

The problem we are hoping to improve involves collaboration through zoom regarding more STEM related fields. In most situations, there is not an apparent way for users to collaborate on zoom apart from one user screen sharing and the rest of the participants using only voice and chat to provide their ideas. This is not sufficient for some situations where more complicated ideas/topics are being discussed. To combat this, we were thinking of implementing a collaborative whiteboard where all people in a zoom meeting can access and draw on a virtual white board.
