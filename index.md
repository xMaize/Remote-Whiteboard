# Welcome to our Remote Whiteboard project!

## What is the problem we're trying to solve?

The problem we are hoping to improve involves collaboration through zoom regarding more STEM related fields. In most situations, there is not an apparent way for users to collaborate on zoom apart from one user screen sharing and the rest of the participants using only voice and chat to provide their ideas. This is not sufficient for some situations where more complicated ideas/topics are being discussed. To combat this, we were thinking of implementing a collaborative whiteboard where all people in a zoom meeting can access and draw on a virtual white board. 

## What is our target audience?

During a “normal” semester, libraries were filled with students collaborating - many times using a single whiteboard. Without this invaluable tool easily accessible to students and professionals seeking a more intimate form of collaboration, the quality of learning drastically decreases[[1]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518). Not only can students of all skill levels/age benefit from a solution to this issue, but also professionals who often utilize open collaboration in their jobs. Software engineers, project managers, and many other professionals use whiteboards as a key tool during brainstorming, so a solution would benefit both users in the classroom and workforce alike who are seeking for more collaborative engagements with their virtual meetings/classes . Therefore, we are seeking to enhance this functionality within remote learning/collaborative tools such as zoom. 

## What are existing solutions?

Zoom is aware of the benefit of having a collaborative whiteboard feature on its platform and has created a proprietary tool to be used within their application. Although zoom has attempted to tackle this, many user’s experiences with the tool have been cumbersome and not well adaptive to a variety of different uses. For example, a tutorial showing how to use zoom’s whiteboard feature has over 355k views since April [[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ4-wrwHAxk). Admittedly, not everyone who is on zoom is seeking this functionality, but for those who are - it is not readily apparent how to utilize it. There are a vast amount of third party solutions, such as the popular online tool “Miro” and Mural, but many times these cater to a specific use and discovering which of the many services would work best is tedious.The issue with other third party online collaborative whiteboards is that it often requires students to navigate or download a brand new software for the sake of using it only a handful of times. Downtime is something teachers (especially those trying to instruct younger children) do not want, so having something implemented within the virtual classroom is key for this specific user base.

### Miro

**Pros**
- Generally easy to use with many pre-built templates.
- The board is basically endless so you can keep different forms of data all throughout such as maps and hierarchies.

**Cons**
- For users who are just visiting, there are problems getting just to see the board such as pop-ups.
- There is also a lack of history of changes.
- Recently added the ability for voice and video call but not optimized.

## What are our guidelines?

The guidelines of a solution depends on the target audience. For instance Zoom, it’s quite obvious that they were looking to target a classroom with their implementation. Their focus was upon ease of use rather than robust features, and it’s even mentioned in their tutorial on it’s usage. On the other hand, Miro is trying to target a working audience by having all of its large toolset and integrations into very popular tools used in the field such as Slack, Dropbox, and JIRA. For our solution we would prefer our solution to be a compromise of the two. Zoom’s implementation is not robust enough for some topics covered in college. Miro’s implementation isn’t simple enough to use, and isn’t well-integrated with tools that a student would use such as Zoom.

## Our Suggested Improvements
- Provide backgrounds of various colors.
- Add ability to add and work with images.
- Ability to limit who can draw on the whiteboard.
- Addition of tools to aid in drawing (i.e. fill, shapes, symbols).
- Ability to zoom which will in turn provides more/less space on the whiteboard.
- Ability to work on the whiteboard without having to share a screen.

## How will we measure success?

- Time in which it takes to draw complex figures/diagrams. 
- Surveying teachers/professors can help determine its usefulness in a classroom setting in particular. 
- Artists can be referenced as they are probably most familiar with drawing tools such as this. 
- Learning curve needs to be measured as it needs to be easy to learn for children, but also complex enough to be used by people in the STEM fields.
