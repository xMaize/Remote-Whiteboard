### User Experience Requirements
- As a student during the pandemic, I want to easily collaborate with other students on a digital whiteboard.
- As a student, I want the digital whiteboard to be seamlessly integrated with the remote learning platform (ie. Zoom)
- As a student, I want the flexibility to see who is contributing and edits others have made on the digital whiteboard in an easy to view/understand format.
- As a professional, I want to be able to host brainstorming whiteboard sessions with my team and then be able to export the information in an easy to distribute format.
- As a professional, I want to be able to see the editing history and a timed progression of the whiteboard as changes are made so that I will have a better knowledge of the thought processes that went into the whiteboard content.
- As a remote instructor, I want to easily change between a digital whiteboard and an alternate presentation so that students remain engaged and there is little downtime to switch applications during valuable class time.
- As a remote instructor, I want students to easily be able to show/submit work done on the digital whiteboard so that the class feels more interactive and collaborative.
