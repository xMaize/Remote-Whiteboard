## User Experience Requirements
### Decompose your proposed solution from Milestone 2 into related user stories.
- As a student during the pandemic, I want to easily collaborate with other students on a digital whiteboard.
- As a student, I want the digital whiteboard to be seamlessly integrated with the remote learning platform (ie. Zoom)
- As a student, I want the flexibility to see who is contributing and edits others have made on the digital whiteboard in an easy to view/understand format.
- As a professional, I want to be able to host brainstorming whiteboard sessions with my team and then be able to export the information in an easy to distribute format.
- As a professional, I want to be able to see the editing history and a timed progression of the whiteboard as changes are made so that I will have a better knowledge of the thought processes that went into the whiteboard content.
- As a remote instructor, I want to easily change between a digital whiteboard and an alternate presentation so that students remain engaged and there is little downtime to switch applications during valuable class time.
- As a remote instructor, I want students to easily be able to show/submit work done on the digital whiteboard so that the class feels more interactive and collaborative.

### Which user stories are most relevant to your proposed solution and why? 
- **“As a student, I want the digital whiteboard to be seamlessly integrated with the remote learning platform (ie. Zoom)”**: The most relevant user stories will be the most broad of the stories as they demonstrate the overall need for our proposed solution of creating a better integrated digital whiteboard feature within the digital learning platforms. This user story places emphasis that our solution must focus on the integration aspect; it cannot simply be a good application/feature, it must incorporate itself well inside its parent environment.
- **“As a professional, I want to be able to host brainstorming whiteboard sessions with my team and then be able to export the information in an easy to distribute format.”**: This user story is very relevant to our solution, because the ability to collaborate in a workplace where brainstorming is a large part of day to day operation, as well as distribute those sessions to others that greatly increases the value of our proposed solution. This functionality opens up demand for our solution not just in classroom settings, but also in the professional workplace.

## Ideation and Preliminary Designs
### Wireframe 1

This design focuses on adding an additional option in zoom to start a new whiteboard meeting on the homepage. Rather than the whiteboard being an extension of a normal zoom meeting, we wanted to separate them and isolate the importance of a whiteboard dominant meeting. We feel that this will provide greater visibility to those seeking the specific feature. Additionally, there is an easy method of adding members to the whiteboard session based on email/username. Once members are added to the session, they can easily be differentiated by color coding them similar to the collaborative view in Google Docs as an example.

Our second design focuses on the ability to switch between call mode and whiteboard mode with a simple press of a button. This button then switches all participants over to the whiteboard where they can each still be seen as indicated by the icons on the right side of the view.

The third design really hones in on the importance of improving on the editing tools within the whiteboard. The options currently available hinder the usability of a whiteboard feature within a video conference application such as zoom, and our solution outlines additional editing features to be added to the whiteboard. On top of the simple tools such as color, shapes, and background, the user can now import images/videos, link important URLs, and even import information from other saved whiteboards. Lastly, we wanted to emphasize the importance of being able to adjust the permissions of participants during a whiteboard session. As an example, this change can allow teachers to remain focused, while offering individual students opportunities to collaborate in front of the class as it would be in a classroom setting.
