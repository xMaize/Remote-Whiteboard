## Testing Protocol
### Research Question
With the increase in virtual learning, does our prototype for an improved Zoom whiteboard incite usability and is it better equipped to handle many different kinds of users?

### Based on your research question, what methodology will you use for testing and why?
The best methodology would be to survey a sample size of certain users and their experience using our prototype. We will ensure that we get an even number of representatives from each use case (students, professors, professionals in the workplace, and members of academia) which will allow us to see for whom our prototype improves the most. The survey will ask general questions regarding the ease of use and the enhancement of features most commonly used. Additionally, we would conduct focus groups for each demographic of users and would allow for additional information regarding specific functionalities of the prototype to be better understood from the eyes of those using the platform the most. These focus groups will include more in depth, town-hall style of questions aiming to gather more detailed recounts of the users experience as well as shining light on persisting issues that still need to be ironed out.

### Based on the methodology you chose, describe your testing procedure
The testing procedure will be relatively straight forward regarding the survey. Because our prototype is created using Adobe XD, we can easily deploy a usable version available for user testing. Because of the large demographic of students and professors at UGA, we will make this survey voluntary to those who are seeking enhanced zoom whiteboard features. This ensures we get users with different backgrounds and who frequently utilize the existing whiteboard. The survey questions will be more broad, intended to gather information about the high-level details of the prototype - such as:
1. How likely are you to use this implementation versus the current Zoom whiteboard?
2. As a student/professor/professional, how much would this implementation improve your day-to-day when needing a digital whiteboard?
3. Do these changes entice you to use the whiteboard more than before?

Once an assortment of these questions have been presented to the surveyee, they will be asked to answer using a scale of 1-5, 1 being the least likely, 5 being the most likely. The score of the results will give us a concrete idea of the reception of our prototype.

After the survey, the user will be asked if they are willing to be a part of a focus group that is led by one of the prototype creators. The format of the focus group will be more conversational, focusing on getting specific likes and dislikes from those using the implementation. During this, we will not be focused on discrete numerical data, but rather focused on generating direct feedback. 

## Testing Procedure
### What is your plan to deal with informed consent?
Making our survey voluntary ensures the participation of consenting participants. Additionally, we will have a mandatory consent form prior to the survey and subsequent focus groups if the person chooses to partake in either testing protocols.

### What specific data will you collect and how will it be organized?
We will need to collect: Age, profession (whether student or otherwise), frequency of zoom usage, answers to the survey questions, and responses from the focus group.

### What type of analysis do you intend to perform with the study data and how will that analysis help answer your research question?
The data collected from the study will directly correlate to answering our research question. Because of this direct method of analyzing the results, the analysis will be relatively minimal outside of the gathering of the data. The numerical results coming from the survey will provide valuable insight into the overall approval of the changes. The detail oriented data gathered from the focus group will allow us to specifically change poorly received features as desired. Based on the numerical results of the survey and the word of mouth feedback from the focus group, these factors will inform us of how well we answered our original research question.

### How might you conduct your testing procedure safely during the pandemic?
Because the digital whiteboard is being improved, it is important that all user tests be conducted virtually. All surveys will be online via email, and the focus groups will be done through zoom meetings. This is the preferred method regardless, because the prototype can be used live during these meetings.
